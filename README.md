Overview of Statistical  Analysis
An investor is interested in knowing the temperature trends for a surf shop or an ice cream shop in Oahu for the months of June and December. These months represent summer and winter, and the research question is to find, if surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round.
Results
The temperature charts for June and December are shown below:
June Temperature
count	1700.000000
mean	74.944118
std	3.257417
min	64.000000
25%	73.000000
50%	75.000000
75%	77.000000
max	85.000000





December Temperature
Count	1517.000000
Mean	71.041529
Std        3.745920
min	56.000000
25%	69.000000
50%	71.000000
75%	74.000000
Max	83.000000

The weather is the almost the same in both the months, however there are some differences:
•	Range- In June the range is 21 degrees, but in December the range is 27 degrees Fahrenheit respectively.
•	The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees. The December Month is colder by 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
•	 Variation- In June the variation is from 25% to 75% is as follows: 73 ,75,77, while in the month of December the variation is from 69, 71,74. So the month of is slightly colder than June with a greater variation. The count and standard deviations of the two data sets are also different.
Summary
Two new queries should be made regarding precipitation and rainfall with wind patterns and their velocities (speed with direction). These queries will give the complete picture to the investor. The winds and ocean currents would contribute to the know-how of surf characteristics. Different types of surf may attract different surfers with different spending habits and needs.
But overall based on current data the project is feasible for year round operation. The Ice Cream Parlor can be opened, without a doubt.
